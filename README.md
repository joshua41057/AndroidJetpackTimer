# Timer Application

## Overview

The Timer application is built upon the principles outlined in the GeeksforGeeks article [How to Create a Timer Using Jetpack Compose in Android](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-timer-using-jetpack-compose-in-android/). This application utilizes advanced techniques to create an efficient and user-friendly timer functionality.

## Functionality

The core functionality of the Timer application revolves around determining the `time_point` position by leveraging cosine and sine functions. These mathematical functions play a crucial role in accurately calculating and updating the position of the `time_point` as the current time changes.

## Implementation Details

The application is designed to dynamically update the position of the `time_point` based on the changing current time. This ensures that the user has a real-time visual representation of the progress of the timer. By employing advanced mathematical functions, the Timer application achieves precision and reliability in tracking time.

## Visual Representation

The default color of the `time_point` is set to green, providing a visually appealing and easily distinguishable marker. As the timer approaches completion, the color dynamically transitions to red, indicating that the timer has finished.

## How to Use

To integrate the Timer functionality into your Android application, follow the steps outlined in the GeeksforGeeks article mentioned above. Ensure that you understand the underlying principles of `time_point` positioning using cosine and sine functions for effective implementation.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the color scheme and visual aspects of the `time_point` based on your application's design guidelines. The Timer application provides a solid foundation that can be extended and modified to suit your specific requirements.
